# Jackbox Vote Manipulation

A simple tool which changes how much your audience vote is worth in voting-based Jackbox games.

## Usage

Copy and paste the script in `jackbox.js` into your Developer Console and run it before joining the audience of each Jackbox game. The exact worth of your vote may be edited on the labelled line. Note that the script must be re-run every time you join a new lobby.

This repository is a documentation of Jackbox's security issues and how they can be exploited. I do not condone any malicious use of this script beyond controlled demonstrations.
